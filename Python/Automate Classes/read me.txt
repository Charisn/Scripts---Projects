This script was created to fill one of my needs to be present in lectures of a seminar times and dates which i could not attend.

The script accepts an array of dates and times.

It opens chromium at the exact day and time of the array and opens the login page in line 28.

After successfully log in it, searches for todays lecture and clicks its link.

Zoom meeting is then opened.

At 22:00 it force kills the application zoom to exit the call. ( All calls ended at 22:00 )
